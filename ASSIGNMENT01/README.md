# Description about the project how you want to contribute with your UX design
But the ocean is in danger! Between global warming, plastic pollution, overfishing, loss of biodiversity, destruction of habitats, the challenges are enormous.

# First Website: Pure Ocean

https://www.pure-ocean.org/en/

Pure Ocean is an endownment fund based out of France that focuses on the protection of biodiversity and fragile marine ecosystems. Pure Ocean has a board of five scientists who invest in projects that have a "strong, innovative dimension, whether technological, ecological or social." It's main purpose is to highlight the problem of endangered under water ecosystems. 

Pure Ocean also promotes racing, sailing and eco-friendly water activities that will promote the saving of the endangered under water society. The Pure Ocean initiative also takes donations to spread awareness to this great project, as they aim to both discover and save the oceans. Attached is a picture of the homepage.

Now, we evaluate the 10 heuristics:

We'll evaluate each one based on the Good & Bad 


### 1. Visibility of system status (informs users about current status)  

Good: Since there is no login or user registration, the website doesn't keep user information. The cookies pop up tells the user that the website fully loaded. Also, in the "Our Projects" tab, the interactive map has points that shrink and grow which tells the user that the website is still active.

Bad: There isn't any indicators such as progress bars or spinning circles that informs the user of an action being made. 

Recommendations: Have more interactive tools. 

Severity Rating: 1

- - - - - - - - - - - 

### 2. Match between system and the real world (website informs the user of information in an appropriate manner)  

Good: The tab on the top of the page is named pretty well, as well as most of the sub sections. 

Bad: A huge note on this is that the shop is all in French. Even though the regular website has both French and English, the website only includes English. Also, the News tab is as a header option bus is also a sub header under the Donate tab which is weird.

Recommendations: Enable English in the shop, and remove the News sub header.

Severity Rating: 3

- - - - - - - - - - - 
   
### 3. User control and freedom (you can undo actions easily)  

Good: User input here is only really in two sections: the contact us page and the shop which requires user controlled input. Both are pretty well setup. 

Bad: One small issue is that if you added an item to the cart by mistake, you can't un-add it or delete it from the same page but you have to go to the cart and delete it.

Recommendations: Enable item deletion from product page.

Severity Rating: 1

- - - - - - - - - - - 

### 4. Consistency and Standards 

Good: Really appreciate the standard in the color scheme throught the whole website. (Dark blue, light blue and white) 

Bad: The shop tab has a totally different design and header which confuses the user, making it seem like a whole other website instead of one tab embedded in the other. Another issue I have is the non-standerdization of fonts throughout the home pages and different tabs, even though the color scheme is consistent the webpage seems to be lacking in this area.

Recommendations: Have shop tab be similar to all the other tabs as well as standerdization with fonts.

Severity Rating: 2

- - - - - - - - - - - 

### 5. Error Prevention (reducing error prone conditions)

Good: None

Bad: Since there isn't much room for user input. The only issue I found was when filling the contact form and navigating to another tab it doesn't warn the user about unsaved work. 

Recommendations: Warn user about unsaved work.

Severity Rating: 1

- - - - - - - - - - - 
   

### 6. Recognition rather than recall (easily accessible and viewable)

Good: The sub headers are mostly well distributed in order to make sure the user knows where to go. 

Bad: "Our Supporters" tab includes both Supporters and Funders which isn't particularly self explanatory and pretty ambiguous.

Recommendations: Add Funders tab.

Severity Rating: 2

- - - - - - - - - - -

### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use (website is tailored to both novices and experts) 
  
Good: The basic landing page shows most of the information straight up and has a good breakdown of topics.

Bad: Expert users may want to get to the different projects quicker instead of having to click onto the projects tab. 

Recommendations: Would be a great improvement if there was a quicker way to show the projects on the home page and have some sort of shorcuts for experienced users.

Severity Rating: 1

- - - - - - - - - - -

### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design (relevant information and highlighted essentials only)
  
Good: None.

Bad: The website is a mess with this in particular. The homepage has so much going on and feels like information is very cluttered. Would be a great improvement if there was a quicker way to show the projects on the home page and have some sort of shorcuts for experienced users. A youtube video with an embedded scroll through news headers is not the best for this heuristic. In the news tab, there is both a side bar and a main bar which contain the same articles which is very confusing. Other examples throughout the site display some redundancy as well.

Recommendations: Unclutter the website by concealing info and distributing it appropriately. Have the pages become more concise and have a better directory. 

Severity Rating: 3

- - - - - - - - - - -

### 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors (helps identify error messages and bring solutions)
  
Good: None.

Bad: In the contact us form I entered an invalid email on purpose but it didn't give me a response it just shaded very light red which isn't adequate communication with the user.

Recommendations: For the example brought up, it would have to bring up a specific error such as "Invalid email. Please use the following format: hello@here.com"

Severity Rating: 1

- - - - - - - - - - -

### 10. Help and Documentation (helps users navigate the site)
  
Good: The only sort of positive thing here is the search bar, however it is not that efficient because it gives back cluttered data that isn't formatted well. There is only a french number and an email. 

Bad: There isn't any page that helps navigate the site since it has so much information. No FAQs that may answer more on how to get involved with these projects other than the projects site or the contact form. The contact us form's headers are also in French. 

Recommendations: Add a FAQ and have a way to make the projects more accessible.

Severity Rating: 2

# First Website: NOAA Fisheries: Protecting Marine Life

https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/protecting-marine-life

The NOAA Fishiries association is serving the a website called the Protecting Marine Life. Under the sponsorship of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as well as the US Department of Commerce, Protecting Marine Life was born into foruition. They evaluate species that are on the verge of extinction as well as species declining in population and conduct research in order to help preserve them.
