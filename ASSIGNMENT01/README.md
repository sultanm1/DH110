## Sultan Madkhali, DH110 Fall 2022
## Description about the project how you want to contribute with your UX design
But the ocean is in danger! Between global warming, plastic pollution, overfishing, loss of biodiversity, destruction of habitats, the challenges are enormous.

## First Website: Pure Ocean

Pure Ocean is an endownment fund based out of France that focuses on the protection of biodiversity and fragile marine ecosystems. Pure Ocean has a board of five scientists who invest in projects that have a "strong, innovative dimension, whether technological, ecological or social." It's main purpose is to highlight the problem of endangered under water ecosystems. 

Pure Ocean also promotes racing, sailing and eco-friendly water activities that will promote the saving of the endangered under water society. The Pure Ocean initiative also takes donations to spread awareness to this great project, as they aim to both discover and save the oceans. Attached is a picture of the homepage.

Now, we evaluate the 10 heuristics:

| Heuristic & Description| Evaluation| Recommendation for "Bad" Element(s)| Severity of "Bad" Element(s) |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1. Visibility of system status (informs users about current status)| 
   Since there is no login or user registration, the website doesn't keep user information. The cookies pop up tells the user that the website fully loaded. Also, in the "Our Projects" tab, the interactive map has points that shrink and grow which tells the user that the website is still active.
   There isn't any indicators such as progress bars or spinning circles that informs the user of an action being made. For example, in the contact us form I entered an invalid email on purpose but it didn't give me a response it just shaded very light red which isn't adequate communication with the user.

    For the example brought up, it would have to bring up a specific error such as "Invalid email. Please use the following format: hello@here.com"
