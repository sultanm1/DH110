# Description about the project how you want to contribute with your UX design
But the ocean is in danger! Between global warming, plastic pollution, overfishing, loss of biodiversity, destruction of habitats, the challenges are enormous.

# First Website: Pure Ocean

https://www.pure-ocean.org/en/

Pure Ocean is an endownment fund based out of France that focuses on the protection of biodiversity and fragile marine ecosystems. Pure Ocean has a board of five scientists who invest in projects that have a "strong, innovative dimension, whether technological, ecological or social." It's main purpose is to highlight the problem of endangered under water ecosystems. 

Pure Ocean also promotes racing, sailing and eco-friendly water activities that will promote the saving of the endangered under water society. The Pure Ocean initiative also takes donations to spread awareness to this great project, as they aim to both discover and save the oceans. Attached is a picture of the homepage.

Now, we evaluate the 10 heuristics:

We'll evaluate each one based on the Good & Bad 


## 1. Visibility of system status (informs users about current status)  

### Good: Since there is no login or user registration, the website doesn't keep user information. The cookies pop up tells the user that the website fully loaded. Also, in the "Our Projects" tab, the interactive map has points that shrink and grow which tells the user that the website is still active.

### Bad: There isn't any indicators such as progress bars or spinning circles that informs the user of an action being made. For example, in the contact us form I entered an invalid email on purpose but it didn't give me a response it just shaded very light red which isn't adequate communication with the user.

### Recommendations: For the example brought up, it would have to bring up a specific error such as "Invalid email. Please use the following format: hello@here.com"

### Severity Rating: 1

- - - - - - - - - - - 

### 2. Match between system and the real world (website informs the user of information in an appropriate manner)  

Good: The tab on the top of the page is named pretty well, as well as most of the sub sections. 

Bad: A huge note on this is that the shop is all in French. Even though the regular website has both French and English, the website only includes English. Also, the News tab is as a header option bus is also a sub header under the Donate tab which is weird.

Recommendations: Enable English in the shop, and remove the News sub header.

Severity Rating: 3

### 3. User control and freedom (you can undo actions easily)  

Good: User input here is only really in two sections: the contact us page and the shop which requires user controlled input. Both are pretty well setup. 

Bad: One small issue is that if you added an item to the cart by mistake, you can't un-add it or delete it from the same page but you have to go to the cart and delete it.

Recommendations: Enable item deletion from product page.

Severity Rating: 1

### 4. Consistency and Standards 

Good: Really appreciate the standard in the color scheme throught the whole website. (Dark blue, light blue and white) 

Bad: The shop tab has a totally different design and header which confuses the user, making it seem like a whole other website instead of one tab embedded in the other. Another issue I have is the non-standerdization of fonts throughout the home pages and different tabs, even though the color scheme is consistent the webpage seems to be lacking in this area.

Recommendations: Have shop tab be similar to all the other tabs as well as standerdization with fonts.

Severity Rating: 2

### 4. Error Prevention

Good: Really appreciate the standard in the color scheme throught the whole website. (Dark blue, light blue and white) 

Bad: The shop tab has a totally different design and header which confuses the user, making it seem like a whole other website instead of one tab embedded in the other. Another issue I have is the non-standerdization of fonts throughout the home pages and different tabs, even though the color scheme is consistent the webpage seems to be lacking in this area.

Recommendations: Have shop tab be similar to all the other tabs as well as standerdization with fonts.
